CodeBug Connect has 1MB of inbuilt storage for programs and data. You can access these files to add or update your programs or access data you've collected:

* over USB, with CodeBug Connect appearing as a removable disk drive
* with a direct connection to your CodeBug Connect with your web browser over WiFi (Internet connection not required).


Connecting using WiFi
=====================

Using CodeBug Connect with WiFi also lets you interact with your programs; 
so you can print messages, see errors or provide data by typing in. It does 
mean your CodeBug has to be connected to WiFi, and your computer will need to 
be able to connect to it. For maximum flexibility, there are a number of ways 
you can connect.

Using an existing Access point
------------------------------

This is probably the most common use case, your CodeBug connect will connect 
to a WiFi access point, such as your home, school or office router, or tether 
to a mobile phone. This means CodeBug Connect can access to the Internet. 
It also usually means other computers connected to the same access point 
will be able to connect to the CodeBug Connect.


CodeBug Connect's Built in access point
---------------------------------------

CodeBug Connect can host its own access point for you to connect your computer.
This setup is great if you're somewhere without WiFi, or for before you've added
the username and password of the access point you want CodeBug to connect to. 

.. note:: If your computer is usually connected to the Internet over WiFi, when 
 it connects to CodeBug's access point, neither your computer nor CodeBug will be able to access the Internet.

Read more about using accessing CodeBug Connect over a :doc:`network`.


Connecting with USB
===================

To make CodeBug Connect appear as a USB drive, press and hold the centre of ``Joytick A`` while plugging CodeBug Connect in. Transfer or edit your files like you would any other on your computer.

.. warning:: To avoid corrupting the files, never unplug CodeBug connect without
 first chosing eject or equivalent in your operating system.

While in USB mode, CodeBug will not run your program until it reboots into Run mode. This is to remove the risk of filesystem corruption if it were to be accessed by both your programs and via USB at the same time. As such, after transferring files you must safely eject and then unplug and replug your  CodeBug Connect for it to run your program. 

.. note:: CodeBug Connect can hold many files and programs, so needs to be told which one to run at boot. See :doc:`boot` for more information.
